# Full Stack Trvia-API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

Trivia is an API designed by udacity.com and developed by students. It allows users to play a trivia game with a set of pre-populated question, while having the flexibility to create new questions and delete others.

The questions are organized by category, and you can choose to play each round either by a particular category or by all available categories. In summary, this app is capable of:

1. Displaying questions - both all questions and by category. Questions show the category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Deleting questions.
3. Adding questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Searching for questions based on a text query string.
5. Playing the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

## Project Objectives

This project has allow us, the students, to practice the best practices for developing and documenting APIs.

Among the specific skills we put into practice were:

- Setting up virtual environment and installing dependencies
- Setting up database
- Developing endpoints and response bodies
- Using Flask-CORS to enable cross-domain requests
- Create error handlers to deal with expected errors
- Testing successful and erroneous requests with unittest


## Setting up the app

Both the backend and frontend have specific instructions on how to deploy the app. Refer to the READMEs in:

1. [`./frontend/`](./frontend/README.md)
2. [`./backend/`](./backend/README.md)

We recommend following the instructions in those files in order.

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server.

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.
